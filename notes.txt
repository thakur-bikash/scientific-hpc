the main goal is to design and analyze methods for computing numerical values - in order to achieve that we approximate, and in order to assess that we assess the work or resources needed to achieve that level of accuracy by assessing i) cost ii) or speed iii) or the efficiency of resource usage

For a while we are interested in:
i) Finding zeroes of a function
ii) Solving Ax = b
iii) Least Squares
iv) Approximating functions by polynomials
v) approximating derivatives and integrals
vi) solving odes
vii) finding the minimum of a function 

Root Finding 

1. Bisection methods
After implementation we will focus on improving it in - reliability or robustness; accuracy and speed or cost.

Example: x = cos x
